title : An Effective Approach to Unsupervised Machine Translation

---

In this paper, we identify and address several deficiencies of existing unsupervised SMT approaches by exploiting subword information, developing a theoretically well founded unsupervised tuning method, and incorporating a joint refinement procedure.

unsupervised optimization objective that combines a cyclic consistency loss and a language model loss over the two monolingual corpora E and F.

$$L = L_{cycle}(E) + L_{cycle}(F) + L_{lm}(E) + L_{lm}(F)$$
