title : Open Domain Event Extraction Using Neural Latent Variable Models

---

We consider open domain event extraction, the task of extracting unconstraint types of events from news clusters. A novel latent variable neural model is constructed, which is scalable to very large corpus. A dataset is collected and manually annotated, with task-specific evaluation metrics being designed.

For Open Domain Event Extraction (ODEE), in contrast, the inputs are news clusters rather than the individual news, and the output is unconstrained types of open domain events and unique schemas with various slot combinations. First, more than one event can be extracted from a news cluster, where events can be flexible in having varying numbers of slots in the open domain, and slots can be flexible without identical distributions regardless of the event type, which has been assumed by previous work on schema induction. Second, mentions of the same entities from different reports in a news cluster should be taken into account for improved performance.

**Event Extraction** work typically assumes that event schemas are given, recognizing event triggers and their corresponding arguments. In contrast, ODEE is a fully unsupervised setting.

**Event Discovery in Tweet Streams** extracts news-worthy clusters of words, segments and frames. Both supervised and unsupervised methods have been used. The former are typically designed to monitor certain event types, while the latter cluster features according to their burstiness.

**First Story Detection (FSD)** systems aim to identify news articles that discuss events not reported before. Most work on FSD detects first stories by finding the nearest neighbors of new documents. This line of work exploits textual redundancy in massive streams predicting whether or not a document contains a new event as a classification task. In contrast, we study the event schemas and extract detailed events.

**Event Schema Induction** seminal work studies patterns and *event chains* for template induction.

In this paper, they adapt slot coherence based on NPMI (Lau et al., 2014) for quantitatively measuring the intrinsic qualities of slots and schemas, which are inherently clusters.
